Bug Report: Incorrect style application in emotion library

## Issue
The emotion library incorrectly applies styles to DOM elements by directly assigning to the `element.style` property. This approach doesn't work correctly with complex style objects and can cause DOM manipulation errors.

## Current Behavior
```javascript
element.style = styles  // Direct assignment fails with style objects
```

## Expected Behavior
Styles should be applied using the `setAttribute` method to properly handle style strings:
```javascript
element.setAttribute('style', styles)
```

## Location
File: packages/emotion/src/index.js
Function: applyEmotion()
Line: ~13

## Impact
- Style application fails silently
- DOM manipulation errors in certain scenarios
- Inconsistent behavior across browsers
